## How this table is generated

The data below is loaded directly from the Tokens Studio exports committed under
`src/tokens/`. The external semantic definitions in
[`src/tokens/Externals/Default.json`](../../src/tokens/Externals/Default.json)
are merged with the Engage and Legacy internals in
[`src/tokens/Internals`](../../src/tokens/Internals/) to reproduce the same
transform that powers our generated CSS. The theme metadata used for grouping
and theme attribution comes from
[`src/styles/themes/tokens.generated.ts`](../../src/styles/themes/tokens.generated.ts),
which is also emitted by the Style Dictionary build.

> **Why it matters:** every alias path shown in the “Alias / Reference” column
> is a direct pointer back to Tokens Studio, so designers and engineers can
> trace a semantic token to the palette or primitive value that feeds it.

## Refreshing the page after regenerating tokens

1. Run `yarn generate:tokens` to pull the latest Tokens Studio data and rebuild
   the generated CSS/theme manifest.
2. Restart Storybook (or reload the MDX page) so the updated JSON and CSS
   modules are re-imported.
3. If you add new token sets, confirm they are surfaced in
   [`tokens.generated.ts`](../../src/styles/themes/tokens.generated.ts) so the
   table can display them.

> **Tip:** The table renders both Engage (default) and Legacy themes. If a theme
> does not appear, confirm its slug in `designTokenManifest.themes` matches a
> JSON file under `src/tokens/Internals/`.

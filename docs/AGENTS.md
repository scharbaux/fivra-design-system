# Documentation Guidelines

This document augments the root `AGENTS.md`. Ensure you understand the repository-wide policies before contributing to `docs/`.

## Content Expectations
- Keep documentation synchronized with component and tooling changes, highlighting cross-framework considerations and migration steps.
- Use concise, task-oriented sections with code snippets that reflect the current implementations in React, Web Component, and upcoming frameworks.
- When documenting icons or shared assets, reference the canonical icon pipeline and note any framework-specific usage.

## Multi-Framework Support
- Provide guidance for integrating components and scripts in each supported framework, flagging any deviations or caveats.
- Update testing and Storybook sections to describe how contributors validate behavior across frameworks.
- Maintain versioned change logs that record how features evolve for different framework targets.

## Review Checklist
- Follow root standards for accuracy, tone, and completeness.
- Whenever documentation reflects a behavior change in code, append a "Functional Changes" note in the associated change record (commit or PR) summarizing the user-facing impact.
- Cross-link relevant component stories, scripts, and architectural docs to help teams adopt multi-framework patterns.
- Mirror the repository release workflow by noting which Changeset entry triggered a documentation update and referencing the resulting version bump recorded in directory `AGENTS.md` files.

## Functional Changes
- Use `<major>.<minor>[.<patch>]` labels instead of dates when recording new entries.

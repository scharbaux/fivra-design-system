# Integrations Documentation Guidelines

This file extends the root `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`. Follow those policies in addition to the integration-specific notes below.

## Content Expectations
- Keep integration guides focused on actionable setup steps, automation workflows, and cross-tool considerations.
- Note any repository scripts, environment variables, or permission requirements that affect the integration.
- Update placeholder pages promptly once integration details are finalized.

## Functional Changes
- Use `<major>.<minor>[.<patch>]` labels when recording updates.
- 1.0.0: Added governance for integration docs, refreshed the Figma plugin meta title, and stubbed Chromatic and Tokens Studio guides.

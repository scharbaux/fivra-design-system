Add Vue Box stories with React-parity controls and shared Box style resolution, plus clean docs code previews for Box stories. Add Box visual + parity regression coverage, refactor React/Vue button adapters to compose Box as a structural primitive, and align Angular button wrappers to the Box reset baseline via `fivra-box` structure classes.

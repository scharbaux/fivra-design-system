Add Vue Box stories with React-parity controls and shared Box style resolution, plus clean docs code previews for Box stories. Add Box visual + parity regression coverage, refactor React/Vue button adapters to compose Box as a structural primitive, align Angular button wrappers to the Box reset baseline via `fivra-box` structure classes, and introduce Vue Typography stories with React-parity controls/docs. Add Typography visual regression coverage and explicit React/Vue Typography docs-source snippets to avoid render-object code previews. Align shared Typography variant CSS with canonical `--typography*` token variables (with legacy fallbacks) so Vue and React resolve typography styles without undefined custom properties. Register local Saans `@font-face` assets and update shared/Angular button font-family fallbacks to remove Google Sans references. Update token generation so emitted typography CSS variables preserve token-exact non-standard font weights (`380`, `570`, `670`) instead of rounded defaults. Migrate all project token/custom-property references and generated theme variables to full kebab-case naming in one pass, and add `yarn verify:css-vars` enforcement to prevent mixed-case regressions.

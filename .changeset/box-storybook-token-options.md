'design-system-icons': patch
---

Add centralized Storybook token-option metadata generated from theme variables and use it in Button/Box stories for consistent dropdown controls. Expand Box controls to expose token-backed prop options and add Box shadow preset support (`shadow-s|m|l`) plus corrected `border-width-*` token variable mapping.

# Angular Storybook Configuration Guidelines

This directory inherits the repository root, `storybooks/AGENTS.md`, and `storybooks/angular/AGENTS.md` standards. Apply the same configuration practices documented in `.storybook/AGENTS.md` while adapting them to the Angular renderer.

- Author configuration in TypeScript with explicit `StorybookConfig` typings.
- Keep addon, alias, and builder settings aligned with the React workspace so shared imports resolve consistently.
- Update the change log below whenever Storybook behavior changes for Angular consumers.

## Functional Changes
- 1.2.0: Added Storybook 9 Angular configuration with shared Vite aliases and production base handling.
- 1.5.0: Switched the Angular Storybook config to `viteFinal` with shared server and production tweaks.
- 1.5.2: Added the Angular Vite plugin loader to ensure internal Angular packages compile in Storybook.
- 1.5.3: Expanded the Vite dev server allow-list to cover the Angular workspace root and prevent 403s.
- 1.5.4: Injected `STORYBOOK_ANGULAR_OPTIONS` via Vite `define` so Angular framework options propagate without runtime errors.
- 1.5.5: Ensured the Angular Storybook runtime loads Zone.js and forwards `framework.options` to Vite so bootstrap works without NG0908.
- 1.5.6: Imported the shared design system stylesheet into the preview to restore theming for Angular stories.
- 1.5.7: Enabled credentialed CORS handling in the Vite dev server while preserving Storybook defaults.
- 1.5.8: Forced the Angular Vite plugin into JIT mode and imported `@angular/compiler` so static builds can render button stories for Playwright.

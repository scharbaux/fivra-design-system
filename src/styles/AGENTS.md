# Theme Assets Guidelines

This file inherits the repository root `AGENTS.md`. Generated theme assets live in this directory.

- `engage.css` and `legacy.css` are produced by `scripts/generate-design-tokens.mjs`; do not edit them manually.
- `tokens.generated.ts` surfaces runtime metadata for theme selection and is regenerated by the same script.
- Run `yarn generate:tokens` after updating any design token exports to refresh these files before committing.

## Functional Changes
- Use `<major>.<minor>[.<patch>]` labels instead of dates when recording new entries.
- 1.0: Added layered `index.css`, theme helpers, and scoped CSS selectors so `data-fivra-theme` toggles Engage/Legacy tokens.
- 1.1.0: Corrected Storybook bundle imports to use `@import ... layer(...)` so generated theme variables resolve reliably.
- 1.2.0: Regenerated Engage and Legacy theme CSS with percent intensity helpers and neutral state-layer aliases.
- 1.3.0: Added a shared `color-mix` utility for components to compose state-layer overlays.
- 1.4.0: Extended the `color-mix` utility with accent-target weighting to support variant-specific overlay mixes.
- 1.5.0: Added Google Sans font assets, imported `fonts.css`, and regenerated themes so typography tokens resolve to the new family.
- 1.5.1: Restored the `@layer` ordering ahead of font imports so bundled theme variables remain available at runtime.
- 1.6.0: Added generated Storybook token option metadata (`storybook-token-options.generated.ts`) so controls can share centralized theme-driven options across components.

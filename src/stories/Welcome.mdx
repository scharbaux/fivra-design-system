<Title>Design System Icons — Welcome</Title>

<Subtitle>Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for product icons</Subtitle>

This repository demonstrates a practical Single Source of Truth for SVG icons exported from Figma. Icons are exported programmatically via the [Figma Icon Exporter](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1533548616572213704/figma-icon-exporter) plugin, opened as a pull request, then normalized and mapped for consumption in code and documentation.

> Figma Icon Exporter plugin [Documentation](https://sofian-design.github.io/fivra/).

## What’s in here

- Collection of SVGs organized by style and category: `src/icons/{outline|solid}/{category}/name.svg`
- A generator that builds a typed icons map: `yarn generate:icons` → `src/icons.generated.ts`
- An `Icon` React component that renders icons by name and style
- An Icons Gallery with filters, search and click‑to‑copy
- CI workflows that optimize icons, keep the generated map in sync, and deploy Storybook

## Typical flow

1. Designers export icons from Figma using the Figma Icon Exporter plugin (see the “Figma Plugin” page).
2. The plugin creates a PR with raw SVGs.
3. GitHub Actions runs:
   - `optimize-icons` (SVGO pass, color normalization).
   - `generate:icons` (produces `src/icons.generated.ts`).
   - Auto‑commits the results back to the PR branch (or uploads a patch for forks).
4. On merge, Storybook builds and deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Using the Icon component

```tsx
import { Icon } from 'your-icons-package';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Icon name="chevron-right" variant="outline" size={24} color="#334155" />
      <Icon name="chevron-right" variant="solid" size={24} color="#334155" />
    </>
  );
}
```

Notes:

- Outline thickness is baked into the `outline` assets. The component intentionally does not expose stroke/strokeWidth props.
- Colors are applied via `fill="currentColor"`; set the `color` prop (or CSS `color`) to theme icons.
- The generator preserves `fill-rule`/`clip-rule` and ignores `<defs>` clip paths to avoid “solid square” rendering.
